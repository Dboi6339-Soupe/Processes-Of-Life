# Processes-Of-Life
This is just a class project I am working on for science.

## Goal:
Excerpt from Summit: "Big! Small! Fast! Slow! From the formation of a galaxy to the interactions between your cells, many natural phenomena that are hard to picture with the human eye. Some, like cell interactions, are hard to imagine because they are small and fast. Others, like the movements of objects in the solar system, are hard to imagine because they are big and slow. Models can help you visualize phenomena that go beyond the limits of your senses. Over the course of the project, you develop a visual to make an hard-to-see process in our universe easier to imagine and understand."

## Essential questions:
* What is the universe, and what is Earthâ€™s place in it?
* How can you use models to make hard-to-see processes visible?

## My Choice of Model and Scale:
I am going to be programming a model of the processes that define life using microscopic animals as the subject view.  My scale for this model will be 1:1 for time while the speed or distance an organism makes will be scaled from 0.432 microns(actual distance covered in real life on average in 1 second by 1 microorganism) a second to 2.16 microns(actual distance covered in 5 seconds) a second (5:1).

If anyone wants to contibute to this project please let me know by heading over to issues, make an issue but make sure it says `[Contribute]` in the title.

Have a Lovely Day!
